# Project 1 - Sequence Alignment
## Due 01/27/2021

![BuildStatus](https://github.com/bwheel12/Project1/workflows/HW1/badge.svg?event=push)

In this assignment, you will implement two classical alignment algorithms and then evaluate each algorithmâ€™s performance with a range of parameters. There are two parts to this assignment and Part 2 requires completion of Part 1. We recommend reading through both Part 1 and Part 2 before beginning this assignment. 

* Part 1 - API and implementation
* Part 2 - Evaluating alignments

### main
Runs all code in align/\_\_main\_\_.py, useful for part 2
```
python -m align
```

### testing
Testing is as simple as running
```
python -m pytest
```
from the root directory of this project.


### Main Contents

The main file contains all the lines of code to run the exercises in part two of the assignment. When single values were requested the are generally printed to the terminal. Matrices and graphs generated are then saved to the main directory of the project. 

## Functions Inherited from Parent PairwiseAligner Class
The class PairwiseAligner is not intended to be called. Rather its two childclasses are to be interacted with directly. The following functions are inherited in each class.

### Initialization of an alignment class
To align two sequences, either a smith-waterman or NeedlemanWunsch object must be initialized. Upon initialization three variables must be passed: a string pointing to the location of a fasta containing sequence 1, a string pointing to the location of a fasta containing sequence 2, and a string pointing to the location of the scoring matrix to be used.

### read_scoring_mat
This function does not take any arguments and simply instructs the software to import the actual values from the scoring matrix file. No argument is given.

### set_gap_penalties
This function is used to set the gap opening and extension penalties to be used. These values are not provided at initilization, because the intent is that the same pair of sequences would possibly be run with multiple gap penalties. This allows gap penalties to be reset quickly and the alignement rerun with out the need to load the sequences again. This function takes two integer arguments. The first is presumed to be the gap opening penalty and the second is the gap extension penalty. 

### set_up_alignment_mats
This function creates the initial empty matrices for the alignment process. Should be called by the user before and inbetween alignment runs. No argument is given.

### check_score_mat
This function looks up the score for a given amino acid pair from the provided score matrix and returns that score. The amino acid pair to be score should each be provided as individual character arguments. While possibe, this is not intended for the user to call. This will be used internally by the step_through function
